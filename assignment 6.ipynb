    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, \n",

    "A class defines the properties (attributes or variables) and behaviors (methods or functions) that objects of that class will have. \n",
    "It encapsulates the common characteristics and functionalities of a group of objects. \n",
    "Think of a class as a blueprint for creating objects, \n",
    "where the blueprint defines what each object of that class will look like and how it will behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object, on the other hand, is a specific instance or realization of a class.\n",
    "It represents a single entity that possesses the attributes and behaviors defined by the class.\n",

    "\n",
    "ans.\n",
    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) together within a class.\n",
    "It allows the class to control access to its internal state and ensures that the object's data is accessed and modified only through defined methods. \n",
    "Encapsulation helps in achieving data hiding and abstraction, providing better security and maintainability of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance: Inheritance enables the creation of new classes (derived or child classes) based on existing classes (base or parent classes).\n",
    "The derived classes inherit the attributes and methods of the base class, allowing code reuse and promoting the concept of hierarchical relationships. \n",
    "Inheritance supports the \"is-a\" relationship, where a derived class is a specialized version of the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
    "It refers to the ability of an object to take on many forms or exhibit multiple behaviors. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading.\n",
    "Method overriding allows a subclass to provide its implementation of a method already defined in the superclass,\n",
    "while method overloading involves defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in the same class or subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Abstraction: Abstraction involves representing essential features of an object, focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "It allows the creation of abstract classes and interfaces that define a common interface for a group of related classes.\n",
    "Abstraction simplifies complex systems by breaking them down into manageable and understandable units.\n",
    "It enables the separation of the interface from the implementation, promoting modularity, and reducing dependencies."

    "2.Multiple Inheritance: Multiple inheritance allows a derived class to inherit from multiple base classes. \n",
    "The derived class inherits attributes and methods from all the base classes.\n",
